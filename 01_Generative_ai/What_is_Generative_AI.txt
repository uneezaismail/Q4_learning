🔍 What Exactly is Generative AI and What Makes It Unique?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate brand-new content — whether it's text, images, music, or code — based on patterns it has learned from existing data.

Unlike traditional AI that focuses on recognition, prediction, or analysis, generative AI is creative by nature. It doesn’t just understand language or images — it creates them.

🛠️ How Do Generative AI Models Actually Work Under the Hood?

Generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of data to learn the structure and features of the input. Once trained, they can generate new data that resembles the original training set.

Key techniques:
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- Transformers
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Diffusion Models
